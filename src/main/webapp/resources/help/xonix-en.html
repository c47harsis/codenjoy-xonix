                        <h2>What is the essence of the game?</h2>

                        <p>
                            You need to write a program for a robot vacuum cleaner,
                            the task of which is The goal is to clean the entire
                            location from dust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The robot vacuum cleaner does not know how to turn on
                            the move and moves in the selected direction until it stops.
                            After the robot vacuum cleaner has stopped, it can
                            decide to move in some available direction
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One player on the field. You can only win when the location is
                            completely cleared. You can only lose driving yourself into
                            a dead end. In this case, you need to ask to restart (see below)
                            the level.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Players compete each in their own location for the title of
                            the fastest and smartest a cleaning robot, after all
                            points are awarded for collecting dust and are removed
                            for driving through already cleared cells.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, the player <a href="register?gameName=sample">
                            registers on the server</a>, specifying your email address.
                            Next, you need to connect
                            <a href="resources/user/sample-servers.zip">from the code</a>
                            to the server via a websocket. This is a Maven project and
                            it is suitable for playing in JVM languages. How to run it
                            see in the root of the project in the file README.txt
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For other languages, you will have to write your client
                            (and then search with us by email:
                            apofig@gmail.com)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Address to connect to the game on the server http://codenjoy.com:

                        <p>
                            Address for connecting to the game on a server deployed on a local network:
                        </p>
                        <pre>ws://[server]:8080/codenjoy-contest/ws?user=[user]&code=[code]</pre>
                        <p>
                            Here [server] - the ip address of the server, [user] - the id
                            of the player, and [code] - your security token, his you
                            you can get it from the address book
                            browser lines after registration / login
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After connecting, the client will regularly (every second)
                            receive a string characters — with the encoded state of
                            the field. The format is as follows:
                        </p>

                        <pre>^board=(.*)$</pre>
                        <p>
                            You can use this regular expression to extract a board from
                            the resulting string. Here is an example of a string
                            from the server:
                        </p>
                        <pre>Board=###########*O#┌**#*##*##*#*#*##****#*#*#######***##*O******##╥#*###**##*#*###**##**←###**###########</pre>
                        <p>
                            The length of the string is equal to the area of the field.
                            If you insert a hyphen character strings every
                            sqrt(length(string)) characters, then you will get a readable
                            field image:
                        </p>

                            The robot vacuum cleaner will automatically turn where the

                            The game is turn-based, every second the server sends your
                            client (bot) the state of the updated field at the current
                            moment and waits for a  command to the robot vacuum cleaner
                            in response. In the next second, the player must have
                            time to give the command to the robot.
                            If you do not have time-the robot is standing still.

                            There are several commands: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT-lead to
                            the movement of the robot in the specified direction until
                            it stops (remember that the direction during the movement
                            can only be changed by signs or a " carousel"),
                            ACT-asks the server to restart the level.

                            The first task is to write a websocket client that will
                            connect to the server. Then make the hero obey the command.
                            Thus, the player will be prepared back to the main game.
                            The main task is to play a meaningful game and win.
